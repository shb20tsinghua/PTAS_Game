This repository hosts the attached code and animation of this paper titled "Geometric Structure and Polynomial-time Algorithm of Game Equilibria" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00747.

The below GIF is the animated line search process of the 2-state 2-player 2-action dynamic game instance generated with random seed 1, which corresponds to Fig.5 in the paper. The animation shows how the algorithm approximates a perfect equilibrium and avoids singular points in the process, where descriptions of the animation can be found in the paper.
