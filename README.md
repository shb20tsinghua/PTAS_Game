# PTAS_Game

Animated line search process of the 2-state 2-player 2-action dynamic game instance generated with random seed 1.
The parallel line search of 6 initial policies find all the 4 perfect equilibria of this dynamic game.

The jumping in the barrier parameter at around 40000th iteration is triggered by singular avoidance, and this singular point is illustrated in the 4th animation, where the line search process cannot proceed without avoiding it.
